- Replace the idea of multipart objects with single objects

- Add the notion of world position to all objects
- World position is a box that represents the objects position in 2D, as if we were looking at it top down
- This position will be used to calculate drawing order and collisions, but is not used for the actual
	drawing of sprites.
- Link the drawing position and world position of objects so we only need to update one when we
	want to move the object.

- Add drawing code that knows the order in which to draw objects based on their world position
